## How Settlements Work

1. **Add Expenses**: Enter expenses in a group, specifying who paid and who shares the cost.
2. **Automatic Calculation**: The app calculates balances for each group member.
3. **Settlement Generation**: Only users who participated in the same expenses can have settlements between them.
4. **Settle Up**: Click "Settle" to mark a payment as completed; a balancing transaction is created.
5. **Real-time Updates**: All balances and settlements update instantly for everyone in the group.

## Deployment & Cache Management

This app includes an advanced **automatic update system** to ensure mobile browsers always get the latest updates **without user confirmation**.

### Quick Deployment Steps:

1. **Build the app** (this automatically bumps the service worker version):

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `dist/` folder** to your web server

3. **Done!** Users will automatically receive the update within 60 seconds

### How Auto-Update Works:

When you deploy a new version:

1. User visits the app (or app checks for updates every 60 seconds)
2. Brief toast notification: "Updating to latest version... ðŸ”„"
3. Page automatically reloads with new version (1.5 seconds later)
4. User is now on the latest version - no action needed!

### Key Features:

- âœ… **Automatic version bumping** on every build
- âœ… **Automatic updates** - no user confirmation needed
- âœ… **Network-first caching** for HTML/JS/CSS
- âœ… **Content-hash based filenames** for asset cache busting
- âœ… **Seamless user experience** with brief notification
- âœ… **Mobile-optimized** service worker
- âœ… **Updates within 60 seconds** of deployment
